                  <li class="list-allow">We shall fully comply with the Nigerian Local Content Development Policy as required by law.</li>
                  <li class="list-allow">We shall promote the improvement of our Nigerian workforce by encouraging training, both locally through in-house training programmes and also by sponsoring personnel to the facilities of our Affiliates. These personnel, mainly Technicians and Engineers will in turn pass on knowledge to other company employees working alongside them at our various projects and facilities.</li>
                  <li class="list-allow">We shall endeavour to, wherever possible, recruit Nigerian personnel resident in, or belonging to, the same area or nearest village to where the work or services are carried out.</li>
                  <li class="list-allow">We shall ensure staff continuing education/training due to the immense benefits accruable to us and our clients. Our new recruits shall undergo classroom type training in basic Engineering and our business environment. Our other cadre of staff, such as senior and intermediate engineers shall attend training course in recognized institutions locally and overseas. The business units shall undergo continuing education courses and attend seminars.</li>
                  <li class="list-allow">We shall source all materials for our works locally, as evidenced by various suppliers invoices for materials supplied for works. The procurement section is encouraged to search nationally for raw materials. However, for some projects some major equipment and materials can only be obtained abroad but this will be kept to a minimum.</li>
                  <li class="list-allow">The company will develop further its Mechanical/Electrical Workshop Facilities and these will be used to fabricate parts for equipment and tools used for its operations to successfully complete project to specification.</li>
                  <li class="list-allow">We shall utilize local Subcontractors wherever possible to assist in execution of the work. Again, evidence of this may be seen from the list of local subcontractors contained herein. This will encourage small local contractors to develop and expand so they in turn will benefit and the economy will grow.</li>
                  <li class="list-allow">In carrying on our business, we shall employ many local service providers, such as Banks, Auditors, Transport Companies, etc.</li>
